## Description

Hangman Game is a classic word guessing game implemented in Kotlin. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player's objective is to guess the word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's body is drawn on the screen. If the hangman's body is fully drawn before the player guesses the word, the game is lost. If the player guesses the word correctly before that happens, the game is won.
